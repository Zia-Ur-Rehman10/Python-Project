# Python-Project
**Objective**
The objective of this project is to explore and identify the key factors that influence property prices in Pakistan. Using data scraped from Zameen.com, the project performs exploratory data analysis (EDA) to uncover patterns, trends, and insights from real estate listings.

**Data Description**
•	Source: Scraped from Zameen.com

**Original Columns (before cleaning):**
Included fields such as property price, area, location, unit type, and other descriptive information.

**Key Graphical Analysis (Inferred)**
Although the original file does not include direct plot images, the project appears to include or suggest the following types of visual analysis:
•	Distribution of Property Prices
To assess central tendencies, spread, and outliers.
•	Price vs Area Scatterplots
To explore correlation between area (sq. ft) and price.
•	Location-wise Pricing Trends
To visualize how location influences pricing patterns.
•	Boxplots
Possibly used to show price dispersion across different cities or categories.
•	Outlier Detection
Likely used Interquartile Range (IQR) or z-score techniques to filter extreme values.

**Findings and Insights**
From the analysis, the following insights were likely obtained:
•	Larger properties (in sq. ft) tend to have higher overall prices, though not always a higher price per sq. ft.
•	Urban centers like Lahore, Karachi, and Islamabad show significantly higher prices per sq. ft, especially in central or upscale areas.
•	Some areas exhibit inflated prices due to commercial potential, social prestige, or real estate hype.
•	Outliers exist — possibly due to data entry errors, luxury estates, or distressed property sales.
